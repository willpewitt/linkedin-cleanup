# linkedin-cleanup
I have too many LinkedIn connections. 

The only way to remove connections is a slow process where you need to manually remove each connection. 

This application will open a browser session, load the connections page and export the connections to a CSV file.

You can then modify the export CSV file to denote which connections to remove. The application will then automate the process of removing the no longer wanted connections. 


Whats done currently 

* Opening of browser and navigating to LinkedIn
* Authenticating
* Automating scrolling Connections page to display all connections


What needs to be done 

* Export all connections to a CSV file
* Processing CSV to decide which connections to remove
* Remove connections
